# Voro_todo — the stained-glass grind list

Task list for the Voronoi luxury layer. Written to be picked up COLD, one task at a
 time, by a session that has not read the whole arc. Read **The metaphysics** first;
  every task below must leave it intact — a pretty result that violates one of these
   rules is wrong work, not partial credit.
 The arc + bombs: `Radio_scape_handover.md`. The durable spec: `Radio_spec.md §8`.

## The metaphysics

1. **Cyto is the layout engine; Voro is an interpretation of its result.** fcose decides
    where the chunks sit; cells, walls, moldings are derived pixels. Pixel geometry never
     pushes back into the layout — ZERO exceptions. (The rack — equipment nodes
      column-packed at the right edge — used to be the one sanctioned exception; it is
       SHELVED behind `RACK_ON = false` in `voronoi_layout()`, kept as the seed of a
        future in|out-group process option. The oddballs just sit where fcose put them.)
       The cautionary tale is `size_stuff_node()`'s voronoi guard: growing a node
        from its own cell's size is a feedback runaway.
2. **Nothing render-side is ever snapped.** c-side (`n.c.*`) or component `$state` only;
    no `%keys`, no `sc` writes, no wave participation. A Book underneath must never be
     able to see the render (the Leaf* Books keep checking Cyto basically works). Free
      self-test: if any Story fixture diff appears from your change, you broke this rule.
       If your design seems to need a snapped flag — stop, the design is wrong.
3. **The crusher is the only minter of `c.stuff` / `c.stuffy`** and it lives in
    `Ghost/V/Voro.g` (`Voro_crush_scan / _walk / _crushable / _clear`). Crush-policy work
     goes there, in the LangTiles DSL, not in raw TS. After a `.g` round:
      `npm run ghost-compile -- Ghost/V/Voro.g` (needs the editor tab open on :9091);
       NEVER edit `src/lib/gen/**/*.go`.
4. **Toggleables are workspace prefs**, remembered in the stash (the `Cyto_voronoi` /
    `Cyto_tall` pattern in Cytui) — never per-graph state, never snapped.
5. **Matstyle reads are free; Matstyle MINTS are writes** under `The/Styles` (snapped!).
    A render path may look a style up but must never cause one to autovivify — fall back
     to a palette colour when the style is absent.
6. **DOM-measure feedback must be damped.** Any `offsetWidth`-style measurement that then
    changes what the same overlay renders (wrap width, font, molding) re-enters
     `voronoi_layout()` as a seed weight. Measure at settle cadence (the
      `show_overlays_soon` / ResizeObserver rhythm, never per-frame) and add hysteresis
       (ignore sub-threshold changes) or the tessellation oscillates.
7. **Verify with eyes on a live :9091 runner.** `node scripts/runner_ask.mjs run
    VoroMitosis --watch` (then `VoroScape`), then WATCH the tab. Headless is banned
     (false greens). No Book can gate pixels — these tasks are verified by watching, and
      by fixtures NOT changing. Never save src mid-run (HMR kills in-flight runs).
8. **No one-off scripts, no vitest specs.** If a task ever grows a testable non-pixel
    seam, that seam becomes a Story Book (registered in Waft:Credence) — but the pixel
     work itself is watch-verified.

## Where things live

- `src/lib/O/Cytui.svelte` `#region voronoi` — `voronoi_layout()` (seeds → power
   walls → polygon moments → molding affine T → fit; the shelved rack rides a false
    flag here), `paint_final()` (walls, notch braces, tips; molds each Stuffing via
     left/top/size/clipPath + a child transform), `morph_voronoi()` (generation tween;
      birth from seed, death to centre), `box_support()` (the one support formula
       walls and fit share).
- Motion: `drag_frame()` (the shared live-repaint loop + per-frame budget self-heal),
   `pan_zoom_motion()`, `show_overlays_soon()` (the settle), `visor_guard` (capture-phase
    wheel steal over the right strip — pass-through for clicks/drags, stands down when
     the page can't scroll, so full-bleed toplevels wheel-zoom), `middle_pan_down`
      (middle-drag pans), `wrap_key` (←/→ walk the story pips from the focused canvas,
       riding Storui's `H.c.story_nav`).
- Overlays: `#region overlays` — `stuff_mounts` holds live mounted Stuffing components;
   `reposition_overlays()` deliberately SKIPS a cell-molded Stuffing (clipPath set):
    `paint_final` owns those. Preserve that ownership split.
- `src/lib/data/Stuffing.svelte` — the Stuffing component itself.
- `Ghost/V/Voro.g` — crush policy + the demo Books `VoroMitosis` / `VoroScape` (a Book's
   world and method share the Book's name EXACTLY, or dispatch silently no-ops).
- Toggles on the ◈ bar (all stash prefs, metaphysics §4): ◈ voronoi, ❝ properCellable
   (wordy loners — %see — get a self-row Stuffing and thereby a cell; default follows
    voronoi mode; rides `node_src`, the live particle now ferried on EVERY wave
     upsert's `.c`), ⬡ family hulls (`Cyto_families`, default on), Vexpandy tall.
- Design notes awaiting agreement: `Voro_microcosm.md` (task 6), `Voro_pinch.md`
   (task 7), `Voro_svg_stuffing.md` (task 8).

## The tasks

Grades: **GRIND** = mechanical against this brief; **GRIND+** = needs local judgment;
 **DESIGN-FIRST** = write a short design note and get it agreed before code.

### Round-2 fixes — LANDED 2026-07-06 (browser-unverified)

Two quick reaches off the owner's first eyes-on pass:
- **`%Opt` hidden in the graph.** `cytyle_classify` now `skip`s `%Opt` (Cyto.svelte) —
   the `Opt/crushCyto` nodes the owner still saw were config scaffolding (VoroMitosis's
    toc declares a vestigial `Opt/crushCyto` even though the seed arms via
     `w.c.crush_wanted`; MusuReplica keeps its opt for real). The crusher already
      ignored `%Opt`; the view hides it too now, universally. The model still carries
       the opt (it gates MusuReplica's crush) — only the render drops it. Optional
        follow-up: delete the vestigial `Opt/crushCyto` from VoroMitosis's toc during
         the owed re-record, so the demo is pure `crush_wanted`.
- **Stuffing width → max-width only.** paint_final forced `child.style.width`, so a
   short line measured as a full box and the affine scaled that wide box down → tiny
    text + dead gap (the owner's exact report). Now `width:''` (keeps `.cytui-stuff`
     max-content shrink-to-fit) + `maxWidth` as the wrap ceiling only, lowered 480→360.
      The mold scales the TEXT, not the padding.

### 9. Sensible intensity: hover around ~9 panes — GRIND+ (tuning, live eyes) — TODO

The owner's first full render read as "too much in one screenful … try to hover around a
 sensible intensity … aim for 9 families or so." Density, not correctness. Needs live
  calibration (can't judge "sensible" from reading), hence TODO. Two knobs:
- Demo-data cap: `VoroMitosis` grows to 12 genera + speciation splits — trim the
   `Botany_genera` pool / cap active genera near ~9 so the colony hovers at a readable
    count (pure demo data, re-record owed anyway).
- Crush aggressiveness: once the co-crush of scattered leaves lands (task 5 open item),
   the loose `%witnessed`/`%reached`/`%req` collapse into single panes, which is most of
    the screenful — that alone should pull the density down toward the target. Calibrate
     the two together with eyes on the tab.

### 1. Wrap width from the cell — GRIND+ — BUILT 2026-07-06 (browser-unverified)

Done as specified below: `paint_final` hands the child a 24px-quantised width off the
 cell bbox, >15% hysteresis (`wrap_applied`), settle cadence only. Watch for the §6
  oscillation check before calling it verified.

Today the Stuffing renders at its natural max-content width and `paint_final` scales
 that fixed box into the cell (fit·T). Invert it: the CELL should hand the content a
  wrap width, so the text re-flows to the cell's proportions and never touches the
   walls — how wide to make the Stuffing to wrap its contents appropriately.
- Where: `voronoi_layout()` already computes the cell's eigenframe (λ1/λ2, φ) and
   centroid; derive a target content width from the cell's extent along its long axis
    (minus a wall margin), set it as an explicit width/max-width on the overlay's CHILD.
- Danger: metaphysics §6 — the child's size feeds the next tessellation as seed weight.
   Quantise the target (say 24px steps) and only re-wrap when it moves by >15%, at
    settle cadence only. Watch a resting graph for a full minute: zero oscillation.

### 2. Angle: a long cell wants a long Stuffing — GRIND+ — BUILT 2026-07-06 (browser-unverified)

Done: the molding composes R(θ)·S — |θ| ≤ 20°, snapped to 0 below 8°, gated on real
 elongation (>1.18) so a round cell's φ noise never tilts text; `box_support` grew a
  T21 (defaulting to T12, so symmetric callers unchanged).

The molding T is symmetric today — a deliberate no-rotation choice so text never
 tilts. Relax it a LITTLE: rotate the Stuffing toward the cell's long axis φ with hard
  legibility caps — |angle| ≤ ~20°, snap to 0 below ~8°, never past vertical (text
   must never read upside-down).
- Where: fold the capped rotation into T (T11/T12/T22 stop being symmetric — that is
   fine, `box_support()` already takes a general T, so the fit stays correct for free).
- Do after task 1; angle without re-wrap just tilts a wrong-shaped box.

### 3. Fold colour by dominant kind + fold-count size — GRIND — BUILT 2026-07-06 (browser-unverified)

Done: the crusher stamps `c.fold_kind`/`c.fold_n` (`Voro_stamp_fold`, gen recompiled
 via LocalGen); Cytui's `cell_color` reads the kind's Matstyle READ-ONLY (o() query,
  border-colour fallback) and the seed floor lifts by `log2(1+n)·9`.

The crusher already returns the dominant child mainkey (`kind`) and the fold count.
- Colour: a fold's cell should carry its dominant KIND's colour, not the fold node's
   own border colour (see the `color:` pick in `voronoi_layout()`). Look the kind's
    Matstyle colour up READ-ONLY (metaphysics §5) with a palette fallback.
- Size: let the fold count accentuate the seed weight (a bigger family claims a bigger
   cell) — a gentle log scale on the hw/hh floor, c-side only.
- Both stats are live returns from `Voro_crush_scan`; if they need to ride to Cytui,
   they ride on `.c`, never `.sc`.

### 4. Family outlines: the w/** hulls — GRIND+ (toggleable) — BUILT 2026-07-06 (browser-unverified)

Done, via post-hoc edge attribution instead of a clip_halfplane rewrite: every cut's
 line is kept and each final wall midpoint-tested against them (`edge_src` on VCell —
  the SVG-Stuffing spec reuses it as free adjacency). Families = cells grouped by the
   compound ancestor one below the w root, ≥2 members; boundary walls stroked as
    disjoint faint segments (visually identical to a traced loop, immune to topology
     surprises). ⬡ toggle, stash `Cyto_families`, default on.

**OPEN — the hull never SHOWS on VoroMitosis (2026-07-06).** Confirmed by reading, not
 eyes: every genus cell sits DIRECTLY under `w` (the crush folds `cell:<genus>`; its
  parent is the run world), so `family_of` — which returns the compound ancestor one
   below the outermost (`anc[anc.length-2]`) — gets `anc.length===1` and returns null
    for every cell. `vfams` stays empty. A hull needs ≥2 cells sharing an INTERMEDIATE
     cyto-compound between them and `w`. The owner's hunch ("put child notes in some
      %Coprosma so I can see it") is aimed one level off: the built hull groups sibling
       CELLS, not a single cell's interior — nesting inside Coprosma deepens that ONE
        cell's fold, it doesn't give two cells a shared parent. Two routes to demo it,
         both more than a quick reach (hence TODO):
- Route A (data, lowest core-risk): group genera into botanical FAMILIES in
   `VoroMitosis_seed` — a compound container per family holding 2–4 `cell:<genus>`
    (Rubiaceae⊃Coprosma, Plantaginaceae⊃Veronica+Hebe…). BUT the only mainkey
     `cytyle_classify` treats as a cyto-compound is `w:`, so the family container would
      have to be a `w:<Family>` sub-world — and minting inert `w:`s inside a run world
       rubs the "mint w only for isolation/snap-boundary" rule; verify the reqdo_sweep
        no-ops on them before trusting it.
- Route B (core): teach `cytyle_classify` a generic grouping compound (a `group:`/
   `clade:` mainkey → 'compound', with make_wave parenting to match). Cleaner model, but
    a shared-core change — prove in isolation first ([[fight-back-on-core-changes]]).

Outline all the cells of each direct child of w — e.g. everything under `Pier/**` gets
 one shared outer outline — but only for families with real structure: at least
  `w/*/*` depth, where a `%witnessed` child does NOT count as structure.
- Approach: cells know their particle; group by ancestor-directly-under-w. The union
   outline = the walls whose cutting neighbour (in the half-plane clip) is OUTSIDE the
    family or is the frame — extend `clip_halfplane` to tag each edge with its cutter's
     id, then trace the untagged/foreign-tagged edges per family into one faint second
      stroke (distinct colour per family, well behind the cell strokes).
- A ◈-bar toggle, stash-remembered (`Cyto_families`), metaphysics §4.

### 5. Crush harder: group the un-same — GRIND+ (crusher policy, .g work) — PART-BUILT 2026-07-06

Built: `Voro_swarmable` in Voro.g — a STRUCTURAL container whose children are a
 homogeneous swarm (≥3, all one noisy mainkey: req|witnessed|see) folds as the
  group's chunk (w/H/A never fold); stamps ride `Voro_stamp_fold` like any fold.
   Gen recompiled (LocalGen; the editor path was down). STILL OPEN: leaf swarms
    directly under w/A with no foldable parent (a sibling GANG needs an elected
     representative + Cyto walk support — design that with task 6's microcosm, the
      machinery overlaps), and the ≥0.8-dominant loosening if strict homogeneity
       proves too shy on real traffic.

**OPEN — co-crush scattered same-mainkey leaves (2026-07-06 owner ask).** The owner
 wants `%witnessed` and `%reached` "crushed further — together into one cell+Stuffing
  each": all the loose `%witnessed` leaves collapse to ONE cell, all `%reached` to
   another. That is exactly the leaf-sibling-GANG above — `Voro_swarmable` today only
    folds a container whose CHILDREN are homogeneous; these are homogeneous leaves with
     NO container, scattered directly under `w`. Folding them needs the ghost to gather
      siblings by mainkey and mint a synthetic fold node (the elected representative) to
       hang `c.stuff`/`c.stuffy` on — new machinery (overlaps task 6). The owner flagged
        it "a lot more work" and agrees; deferred, tracked here.

`Voro_crushable` wants same-ish children, so `%witnessed:$different_stuff` (same key,
 different sentences — they aren't resolving as same) and swarms of `%req:awaitbuf`
  and kin escape the fold and litter the graph. Fold them anyway, as GROUPS:
- Loosen "same" to same-MAINKEY-varying-VALUE for designated noisy families
   (`%witnessed`, `%req` at minimum), each group folding behind its own chunk whose
    skin shows the spread (e.g. `witnessed ×14 · 9 distinct`).
- This is `Ghost/V/Voro.g` work (metaphysics §3), c-side throughout. Subgraphing them
   — one group-chunk with the members as its microcosm — is task 6's territory; here
    just get them folded and the graph tidier.
- Verify on VoroMitosis: the genus panes must still read; fixtures must not move.

### 6. Composite shapes: layout WITHIN a cell + zoom-recursion — DESIGN-FIRST — NOTE WRITTEN

`Voro_microcosm.md` (2026-07-06): no second w:Cyto, no channels — crunch on subsets
 in-pixel (the crush only suppressed descent; members are `fold.o()` away). Carves
  (a) grid microcosm, (b) hysteretic zoom-swap, (c) pixel-capped recursion. Await
   owner agreement, then build (a).

Can the composite shapes be custom — i.e. lay a fold's members out INSIDE its cell (a
 microcosm: mini grid or mini force pass in the cell's own frame), instead of one flat
  Stuffing? And effortless zoom-recursion through any: zooming into a cell swaps its
   Stuffing for its microcosm, progressively, without the C tree ever changing (the
    crushed children are all still in C — the crush only suppressed Cyto's descent).
- Carve: (a) static grid microcosm in a cell, (b) zoom-threshold swap Stuffing ↔
   microcosm, (c) recursion (a microcosm member with its own fold gets its own cells).
- Write the design note first: coordinate frames, when the mini-layout runs (settle
   only), and how it stays inside the budget self-heal.

### 7. Scroll = pinch|spread the locale — DESIGN-FIRST (toggleable) — NOTE WRITTEN

`Voro_pinch.md` (2026-07-06): gaussian brush (σ≈140px) via model-position writes
 through cy, guarded off running layouts, riding pan_zoom_motion; fcose undoes the
  sculpt and the note says so plainly (fine for a play-mode). Await agreement.

A mode where the wheel does not zoom the camera but contracts|spreads THAT LOCALE of
 nodes — wheel toward pulls the neighbourhood under the cursor together, wheel away
  spreads it apart (a gravity brush).
- Position writes here are LAYOUT-side input (like a user drag), so they're allowed —
   but only while no layout is running, and they must go through cy positions so the
    normal motion loop re-tessellates.
- Stash-remembered mode toggle; the visor keeps owning the right strip either way.
- Design note first: the falloff curve, the radius, and how it coexists with fcose
   (does the next wave undo the sculpting? probably yes — say so, and decide whether
    that is fine for a play-mode).

### 8. The SVG-native Stuffing rebuild — DESIGN-FIRST (the big one) — SPEC WRITTEN

`Voro_svg_stuffing.md` (2026-07-06): tuple model (rows with stable rids, monospace
 char-metrics so NO DOM-measure feedback), per-shared-wall greedy matching over the
  task-4 `edge_src` adjacency, band placement (walls never move for rows), SVG text
   paint, settle-only budget, `Cyto_svgstuff` side-by-side migration. Await
    agreement before any build.

Rebuild Stuffing rendering in SVG with graph-native neighbour awareness: rows/tuples
 as SVG text the tessellation itself places, so shared-wall neighbours can EDGE
  TOGETHER — corresponding tuple fields aligning across the wall, matched rows
   gravitating to the shared wall and lining up; a subgraph to compute, involving the
    microcosms of several adjacent (or not) cells.
- This obsoletes the HTML-molding path (tasks 1-2 are still worth doing — they teach
   the geometry and survive as the fallback renderer).
- Requires: a tuple model of Stuffing content (key:value rows), a per-shared-wall
   matching solve (which rows correspond), a placement solve (nudge both sides' row
    order/offsets), then the SVG paint. Do NOT start this as a grind task — write
     `Voro_svg_stuffing.md` (problem, tuple model, solver sketch, budget story) and
      get it agreed first.

## Standing verification loop (every task)

1. Edit; typecheck by grepping `npm run check` output for YOUR line ranges only
    (~3k baseline noise; `cy`-typed-as-void errors are the file-wide disease, ignore).
2. `.g` touched? `npm run ghost-compile -- Ghost/V/Voro.g` with the editor tab open.
3. `node scripts/runner_ask.mjs run VoroMitosis --watch`, then `VoroScape` — green, and
    the diges/fixtures UNCHANGED (a fixture diff = metaphysics §2 violated).
4. Eyes on the tab: drag a node, wheel-zoom, middle-drag pan, click the canvas and
    ←/→ through the pips, run a wave — the Stuffings stay seated and glidy
     throughout; no oscillation at rest.
5. Leave everything uncommitted; the human reviews and commits on the host.
