# Story, next level — one enWaft, continuity, time-surfing, fuzz```

A scheme, not a fix. Diffmatication works badly and wants a full shakeout, but
 the shakeout is downstream of a bigger merge: there are **two snap encoders** in
  the tree doing nearly the same walk, and the interesting features (surf an
   object through time, label acknowledged non-determinism, fold a huge snap into
    a fern garden) all want the *same* missing thing — a **continuity map** that
     says which particle in step N is which particle in step N+1, carried as
      out-of-band `objecties` so every consumer reads it the same way.

This spec lays out that merge and the features it unlocks. Nothing here is built
 yet; `⛑️` marks the gaps. The snap line shape lives in `NOTATION.md` and in Text
  (`enL`/`deL`); read this alongside `Hovercraft.design.md` (req/maz, ttlilt,
   `beliefs()` as a `Selection.process()`).

## 0. The notation, briefly

`%Step` is a live session step; `%step` is its canonical-on-disk twin (see CLAUDE.md
 — `The` is storage, `This` is the session). A snap line is `stringies` (the
  diff-comparable, persisted part) then a TAB then `objecties` (out-of-band JSON,
   never diffed, never identity). Today `objecties` carries `{"mung":["age"]}`,
    `loopy:N`, `hid:1`. This spec mostly adds keys *there*.

---

## 1. Where we are: two encoders, one walk

There are two implementations of "walk a C tree, emit a snap":

- **Text** — `enWaft` → `encode_wh_lines` → `enLine`. Two passes: a `Travel.dive()`
   ref-count pass (`ref_count`, `ref_min_d`) then a `Travel.forward()` encode pass
    that stubs deeper occurrences of a shared C (`loopy:N` on the shallowest,
     `hid:1` munged shadow on revisits). Protocols are inline rule sets
      (`WAFT_PROTOCOL` = `Waft|What|Doc|Point`, each with `omit_sc: SESSION_KEYS`).
       Rules carry `omit_sc`, `blockquote_these_sc`, `munging`, `thence_matching`.
        Has a decode side too (`deWaft`/`decode_wh_lines`), though loopy-decode
         throws — `⛑️ <` not built.

- **Story** — `snap_H` → `story_process_node` → `enL`, plus `encode_toc_snap`/
   `decode_toc_snap` for the `The/**` tree. `snap_H` is built on
    `Selection.process()`: `each_fn` encodes a node, `trace_fn`/`traced_fn` mirror
     the walk into a D-tree and set `D.sc.changed` / `D.sc.is_new` by comparing to
      `bD` (the **before-D**, the prior step's D at this path). It does its *own*
       loopy pass afterward (collect `loopy_Cs`, stamp `loopy:N`, stub revisits
        with `hid:1`) — a second, hand-rolled copy of what `encode_wh_lines`
         already does.

These have drifted. They munge differently, they track loopy differently, they
 disagree about `SESSION_KEYS`. Diffmatication then reads the *output* of Story's
  encoder and re-derives identity by string-parsing (`dm_identity` = first
   `mainkey:value` of the stringies). Three places, three notions of "same
    particle."

**The merge.** One `enWaft` in Text, parameterised, owns the walk, the loopy
 pass, the protocol matching, and `enL`/`deL`. Story stops hand-rolling `snap_H`'s
  loopy pass and instead *passes Story-ness in* as parameters. Diffmatication
   stops re-deriving identity and *reads it out* of the side channels (§2).

### 1.1 The unified `enWaft` signature

`enWaft` already takes `{ all_knowing, matching, muted_log, max_child_depth }`.
 Grow it to accept the Story hooks that `snap_H` currently inlines:

```
enWaft(C, {
  matching,           // protocol rule set (WAFT_PROTOCOL, story_matching, …)
  max_child_depth,
  muted_log,

  // — Story parameterisation (new) —
  process?:   Selection,        // reuse a Selection across steps for continuity
  channels?:  Channel[],        // side channels to emit alongside Snap:H (§2)
  decorate?:  (n, T, mark) => void,   // last-chance line mark (glyph or objecties)
  bD_of?:     (T) => TheD | undefined,      // supply the before-D for continuity
}) => { channels: { [name]: { snap, dige } }, errors, muted_log, Se }
```

The key idea: `enWaft` always builds (or is handed) a `Selection`, so the D-tree
 mirror — the thing `snap_H` already produces — is *always available*, not a
  Story-private side effect. `beliefs()` is already "a `Selection.process()` over
   H/A/w" per Hovercraft.design; this just makes the snap encoder the same shape.

The loopy pass moves wholesale from `snap_H` into `encode_wh_lines` (it already
 lives there for Text). Story deletes its copy. `story_process_node`'s munge/
  blockquote/skip rules become a `matching` protocol (call it `STORY_PROTOCOL`)
   passed in, exactly like `WAFT_PROTOCOL`.

> Open: `enWaft` is `async` and walks once; `snap_H`'s loopy pass walks twice more.
>  The merged version should keep Text's two-pass (`dive` then `forward`) and fold
>   Story's third walk into the `forward` pass. ⛑️ verify the ref-count pass sees
>    the same tree Story's `process_sc:{snap_root:1}` selection sees.

## 2. Channels — the snap is plural, the main one stays clean

A snap is already more than one stream: a step's capture is `Snap:H` (House state)
 plus `Snap:cytowave` (graph data). Make that explicit and open-ended: **a step
  captures N channels**, each independently encoded, fuzz-wrangled (§4), diged, and
   diffed. The test suite grows channels the way it grows tests.

Why split: **a true text representation that isn't full of noise matters.** The
 main `Snap:H` channel should read like the House actually looks — clean lines, no
  machinery bolted on. Everything that is *about* the snap rather than *in* it
   (ref linkage, continuity, the event trace) belongs in its own channel, off to
    the side, where it can be as noisy as it needs without wrecking the one
     representation a human reads and diffs.

And a channel is not merely a stream. Waft_spec says *"the Interest **is** the
 channel."* Read that literally and the whole test machine collapses into the Waft
  machine: a test **is** a Waft, each channel is an **Interest** locking onto it
   through a lens, and the cursor that Lang drives through a Doc is the same cursor
    that traces an expected snap through time. That unification is the spine under
     everything here — laid out in §13; the sections between build the parts it
      assembles.

### 2.1 The channel set

- `Snap:H` — the canonical **clean** House text. The thing you read.
- `Snap:refs` — **ref-continuity** (loopy/hid) lifted *out* of `Snap:H`. The same
   `C` reappearing is a linkage fact, not House content; today it litters the main
    text with `{"loopy":N}` / `hid:1` stub lines. Move it. `Snap:H` then shows each
     particle once, cleanly; `Snap:refs` records "this line and that line are one C."
- `Snap:cont` — **non-ref continuity** across steps (§2.3): which line continues
   which from the prior step, what's `new`/`gone`, `.vers` bumps.
- `Snap:trace` — the event stream (§2.4).
- focused probe channels — declared captures (§2.5).
- `Snap:cytowave` — the existing graph wave.

Each channel carries its own dige, so determinism is checked **per channel**: a
 test can pass on `Snap:H` while a probe channel flags drift, or the trace channel
  catch non-determinism the settled House state hides (§2.4).

### 2.2 Three ways to mark — cheapest noise wins

When a fact *must* ride inline on a line rather than in a side channel, there's a
 noise hierarchy:

1. **a side channel** — zero noise in `Snap:H`. The default for refs, continuity,
    trace.
2. **a unicode glyph on a peelable** — the stringies are peel format
    (`k:v k2:v2`, space-separated, sayable); a single glyph tossed onto a token
     (`req:Store↺`, a leading `◇`) marks a line without a JSON blob and *stays
      readable text*. The peel codec already round-trips this; `deL` just needs to
       peel the glyph back off.
3. **objecties JSON** — `\t{"loopy":1,…}` after a tab. Full structured data, but it
    ends the line in a JSON object — the noisiest option, and `enL` only adds the
     tab when objecties is non-empty, so today every `loopy`/`mung` line pays it.

The rule going forward: prefer (1), then (2); spend (3) only when the data is
 irreducibly structured (a `mung` list, a `ref` payload). `Snap:H` should ideally
  carry **no objecties at all** — a clean canonical line per particle.

### 2.3 Continuity, as a channel not a blob

The snapper already resolves continuity and throws it away. `trace_fn` keys each D
 on the node's **full** `the_*` identity; `traced_fn` pairs each D to its `bD` (the
  prior step's D at that identity), setting `is_new`/`changed`. Two kinds:

- **ref-continuity** — the same `C` reappears → `Snap:refs`.
- **non-ref-continuity** — a *different* `C` resolving to the *same D-identity* the
   snapper saw last step → `Snap:cont` (or, when surfing wants it inline, a glyph
    per §2.2, never JSON in `Snap:H`).

Why it matters is unchanged: Diffmatication re-derives identity by parsing the
 first `mainkey:value` of each line (`dm_identity`) — strictly worse than the
  snapper's full-identity resolution, and it collides on sibling particles, patched
   with `:1`/`:2` suffixes. The fix is still "write down what the snapper knew"; the
    revision is *where* — a channel, keeping `Snap:H` clean, not objecties on every
     line.

`Snap:cont` records per step: `cont` (continued, same D-identity, not a ref), `new`
 (no `bD`), `gone` (`bD` with no D — a ghost, §5), `vers:[n,m]`. Surfing (§3.2)
  reads it; the fern fold predicate (§6) rolls it up. No global object-id, no
   cross-reload scheme — only the snapper's per-step resolution, written to a side
    channel. (Same `Selection.process()` Map pass Lang wants for the doc Map via
     `regroup()`: one pass, Lang reads it for space, Story for time.)

### 2.4 The trace channel

The event stream — `Run.trace(kind, tag)`, the ticks | attends | thinks | beliefs |
 elvis | ttlilt flow — wants the same treatment as House state: **store it as a
  channel and wrangle its non-determinism** (§4). The trace is the noisiest thing
   in the system — timing jitter on every line, ordering that varies run to run —
    so raw it is undiffable. Fuzz-wrangled (timings classed `kind:timing`,
     run-to-run ordering `kind:ordering` — sorted to canonical where it can be,
      acknowledged where it can't) the channel diffs down to *did the same sequence
       of attends/thinks/beliefs happen*, which is exactly the question a flaky test
        asks.

A diged trace channel is a stronger assertion than `Snap:H` alone: not "the House
 ended up the same" but "it *got there* the same way" — same beliefs walk, same
  elvis order. Much non-determinism is invisible in `Snap:H` (it settles to the
   same final state) yet shows up first in `Snap:trace` (it settled *differently*).
    The TimeSpool `surprise` trend (§4.3) should run **per channel** — surprise in
     the trace channel is an early warning the House-state channel hasn't caught.

### 2.5 Focused probe channels

Channels are configurable and can be **high frequency, hooked at trace points**. A
 probe channel declares what to catch:

- a certain elvis going somewhere — `elvisto('Story/Story', 'fn', …)` matching a
   pattern, captured every time it fires, with args.
- exact `ticks` | `attends` | `thinks` | `beliefs` for one ghost — chase a single
   actor's heartbeat without the rest of the trace's noise.

Each probe is its own channel: its own snap text, fuzz protocol, dige, and diff to
 surf. Chasing a bug becomes "turn on a probe for this elvis, run the test, diff
  the probe across runs" — declarative capture that lives beside the test, not
   scattered `console.log`. ⛑️ probe-declaration syntax and the trace-point hook
    API are unspecified; `trace_enable`/`trace`/`trace_drain` is the substrate.

---

## 3. Diffmatication shakeout

Don't fix it piecemeal; rebuild it on the merged encoder + continuity map. The
 current correlation-by-string-parse (`dm_correlate`, `dm_identity`) goes away —
  it re-derives, badly, what `objecties.cont` now states.

### 3.1 Keycodes, matching Story

Story's `handle_story_key` is the model. Bring the same vocabulary to
 Diffmaticui (today it only has Arrow-nav, `p` to cycle, Esc):

| key | Story today | Diffmatication wants |
|-----|-------------|----------------------|
| `e` | cycle exp ↔ prev | toggle exp ↔ prev (same) |
| `r` | raw (`naive`) snap, no diff | raw snap, one-way (same) |
| `f` | first ↔ got (Resnapture) | first-vs-now across all time |
| `t` | trace panel | trace panel |
| `a` | expand | expand |
| ←/→ | — | step nav (keep) |

Replace the `p` three-cycle (`prev→exp→next`) with Story's explicit `e`/`r`/`f`,
 plus a new mode for §3.2. Reuse Story's `eff_mode` auto-logic verbatim: an `ok`
  step defaults to raw, a mismatch prefers `exp`, fallback `prev`.

### 3.2 Surfing one object through time

The headline feature. Pin an object (click a row — pinning already exists, keyed
 by `dm_identity`; rekey it to the snapper's D-identity read from `Snap:cont`).
  Then ←/→ no longer steps the *snap*; it steps *that object* along its `cont` chain
   and shows:

- its stringies at each step (the diff is now temporal, object-local);
- its continuity transitions — when it appeared (`new`), continued (`cont`),
   bumped `.vers`, vanished (`gone`);
- a sparkline of `.vers` over the steps it lived.

This works only because the snapper marked its D-identity (§2). With
 `dm_identity`'s first-mainkey guess you can't reliably find "the same object" in
  step N+1 — which is precisely why Diffmatication is unreliable today.

### 3.3 The pip, re-decorated

The pip (step indicator, `·`/`○`, `ok`/`hollow`/`busy`) gains continuity-aware
 decoration:

- a step whose only changes are **acknowledged non-determinism** (§4) draws a
   distinct glyph — not pass-green, not fail-red, a third "noisy-but-ok" mark;
- a step that introduced new object refs vs. fewer than expected can tint;
- hovering a pip can preview the continuity delta (`+2 new, 1 gone, 3 vers-bumps`).

---

## 4. Acknowledged non-determinism + TimeSpool

`TimeSpool` exists today (Story `spool_time_sample` / `The/TimeSpool`,
 `{TimeTotal:'beliefs'}` keeping the last 10 timing samples, oldest evicted). It
  is timing-only. Generalise it into the home for **acknowledged non-determinism**.

### 4.1 The fuzz problem

Most step-to-step `Dif:change` rows in the example snap are *not* real changes —
 they're timestamps and counters: `at=1781596211.071` vs `at=1781589646.55`,
  `round=35` vs `round=38`, `want=…`, `time,compile=0.002` vs `0.003`,
   `walked_at`, `seeded`. These already get `{"mung":["age"]}` so they're flagged,
    but the diff still lights them up as `Dif:change`/`Dif:prev`, drowning the one
     row that matters.

These are **acknowledged non-determinism**: known, expected, allowed to vary. The
 goal is to *wrangle and label* them so they read as `Dif:fuzz` (or fold away
  entirely, §6), not `Dif:change`, and to *track whether the fuzz is growing*.

### 4.2 Classifying fuzz

The `matching` protocol already munges these (`mung:["age"]`). Extend a rule
 `means` with a fuzz class:

```
%fuzz,kind:age      monotonic time/age field (at, seeded, walked_at)
%fuzz,kind:counter  free-running counter (round, want)
%fuzz,kind:timing   measured duration (time,compile / all)
%fuzz,kind:ordering set/map order that varies run to run
```

The class is a line mark, so it follows the §2.2 hierarchy: a fuzz glyph on the
 peelable (`at⌁` say) keeps `Snap:H` readable, beating a `{"fuzz":…}` JSON blob.
  Diffmatication then renders a fuzz row as `Dif:fuzz` and the pip uses the §3.3
   "noisy-but-ok" glyph when a step's *only* non-`same` rows are `fuzz`. Trace and
    probe channels carry their own fuzz classes (§2.4) — `kind:timing`/`ordering`
     are the trace's whole problem.

### 4.3 TimeSpool → a non-determinism trend

The point of keeping a spool (not just the last value) is to answer: **is the
 non-determinism increasing, or vanishing?** Extend each TimeSpool sample beyond
  timing:

```
The/TimeSpool/{Sample,at}/{channel:H}      // one per channel (§2)
  fuzz_rows:    N        // count of Dif:fuzz this run
  surprise:     M        // Dif:change rows NOT covered by a fuzz class
  new_refs:     K        // Snap:cont `new` count
  gone_refs:    G        // Snap:cont `gone` count
  vers_churn:   V        // sum of .vers bumps
```

Per channel, because a test can be calm on `Snap:H` and noisy on `Snap:trace`
 (§2.4) — the spool needs to see each.

With the last-10 window already there, a simple slope over the spool tells you
 fuzz is creeping up (a test getting *more* non-deterministic — usually a
  regression) or settling toward zero (good). **`surprise > 0` is the real
   failure signal** — a change no fuzz class accounts for. Today that's buried;
    with the spool it becomes a first-class, trended number per test.

> A test may *acquire* fuzz legitimately (new timestamped field). The flow: it
>  shows up as `surprise`, a human acknowledges it by adding a fuzz rule, it moves
>   to `fuzz_rows`. The spool shows the surprise spike then the return to baseline.

---

## 5. Ghosts — `gone` rows from `Snap:cont`

Path-diff today can only say a line is `left_only`/`right_only`. With the snapper's
 continuity, a vanished object is `gone` and can be drawn as a **ghost row** at its
  last-known position (its `bD` knows where it was). This matters for
   surfing (§3.2): an object's timeline shouldn't just stop — it should show the
    step where it died, decorated. Reuse the existing fade-out animation
     (`opacity`/spring) the ui already runs frame-to-frame; a `gone` row fades but
      stays a tick so the eye catches the death.

---

## 6. Fern gardens — folds from the continuity map

The example snap is mostly `Dif:unchanged count:36` / `count:52` runs already —
 `squish_context` collapses unchanged stretches. That's a flat squish. The
  continuity map enables **structural** folds: present a large snap/diff as a
   *fern garden* — fronds that stay curled until you need them.

A frond is a subtree whose continuity is *uniform*: every descendant is `same` or
 only `fuzz`. The snapper's per-node continuity already knows this (roll up `cont`/
  `new`/`gone` + `fuzz` over children). So:

- a subtree that's entirely `same` curls to one frond line (deeper than squish:
   it's identity-aware, so it won't curl two *different* objects that happen to
    look alike);
- a subtree that's `same` modulo fuzz curls with the noisy-but-ok glyph;
- a subtree containing a `surprise` or `new`/`gone` ref stays *uncurled*, drawing
   the eye exactly to where real change lives.

This reuses Lang's fold machinery conceptually — `Lang_apply_openness` folds a doc
 around engaged Points; a fern garden is the same move applied to a snap diff, with
  the curl/uncurl decision driven by continuity rather than by cursor engagement.
   ⛑️ the actual fold widget is Diffmaticui work, but the *fold predicate* is a pure
    read of the snapper's per-node continuity.

---

## 7. Cyto symmetry — one delta, three renders

Cyto already does this diff. `make_wave` is documented `Ze n=topC → diffs C** vs
 bD** → wave`, and it takes `(adjacent, backwards, departing, absolute)` — it diffs
  the live C-tree against its `bD` and animates the delta *in either direction*
   (the `backwards` flag). That is the same `bD` resolution the snapper uses (§2)
    and the same forward/back the surf wants (§3.2). Three renders of one delta:

- **Cyto** — nodes move, pulse, fade (the wave).
- **Diffmatication** — rows align, change, ghost.
- **the channels** — `Snap:cont` (`cont`/`new`/`gone`/`vers`) and `Snap:refs`.

Pull the `bD`-diff into one primitive all three consume. Then **cross-drive** them:
 click a Diffmatication row ⇒ fire a Cyto wave centred on that object's node;
  hover a Cyto node mid-wave ⇒ scroll Diffmatication to that object's row and
   unfold its frond (§6). The two views become one instrument seen from two sides.
    Cyto's wave already carries `step_n`/`absolute` — the same step axis as the
     pips, so the strip (§10) can scrub Cyto too.

> Open: Cyto diffs *live C* vs bD; Diffmatication diffs *snap text*. The shared
>  primitive is the `bD` resolution, not the rendering. ⛑️ decide whether
>   Diffmatication decodes snaps back to C (needs loopy-decode, still `<`) or Cyto
>    learns to wave off a decoded snap. The latter lets Cyto replay *saved* history,
>     not just the live run — a big win for surfing.

## 8. ttlilt — the wait/wake primitive, and seeing it

### 8.1 Seeing what held the step up

A req arms `req/%ttlilt,until_ts` to ask for time before Story snaps;
 `i_Story_o_req_ttlilt` gathers them onto `Run.o({ttlilt:1})` carrying `of_w` +
  `req` + `until_ts`, and `o_Story_req_ttlilt` already traces
   `"held by w:X k:v +Nms"` into the per-step `Run_trace`. So for every step we
    already know *exactly* which ttlilts gated it, whose req, which world, how long.
     Surface it:

- a step's panel lists the ttlilts that held it — `w:LakeFlush req:Store +203ms` —
   read straight from the captured `Run_trace`.
- each ttlilt **links to its req's row in the diff** — the req particle is right
   there in the snap (`req:Store,eternal,maz=7` in the example). The link is the
    `req` backlink → that line.
- clicking the link **induces the fern garden to unfold** the frond containing that
   req (§6), so you land on it even when it was curled — the same move as
    `Lang_apply_openness` opening a doc around an engaged Point.
- a ttlilt that **timed out** (`poll_ttlilt_expired`) decorates red: it held things
   up and never delivered.

This ties timing to structure: "this step took 6s — these three ttlilts; here they
 are in the tree; here's what each was waiting to write." The TimeSpool slope (§4.3)
  says *whether* a step is getting slower; the ttlilt links say *what* is making it
   slow and *where* it lives.

### 8.2 ttlilt owns the wake — one impulse, not two

§8.1 surfaces ttlilt; this is the deeper move that makes the surfacing total. ttlilt
 today is **half a timer**. `i_req_ttlilt` (`Hovercraft.svelte:180`) arms
  `req/%ttlilt,until_ts`, and the header is explicit (lines 172-174): it *"does NOT
   cause think()/reqyoncile() to re-fire at until_ts — it only tells Story.poll_step
    this slice of wall-clock isn't quiescent yet."* So ttlilt is the **snap-coherence
     half**: "don't snap me, I'm waiting until T."

The **wake half** — "ping me at T to re-check" — is *not* ttlilt. It is the scattered
 raw `setTimeout(() => { req.c.recheck_pending = false; H.feebly_ponder() }, …)`
  pattern, hand-rolled in every waiting do_fn (Peeroleum's `recheck`, the loader's
   `repoke`, story_drive's poll loop), each with its own `recheck_pending` dedup flag.
    So **a waiting do_fn arms two things** — a ttlilt for the snap *and* a
     setTimeout→feebly_ponder for the wake — saying the same thing twice. That
      redundancy is the smell.

Fold the wake into ttlilt. `i_req_ttlilt(req, secs)` becomes arm-wait-**and**-wake:
 the engine keeps **one coalesced timer** at the soonest `until_ts` across all live
  ttlilts (the publisher `i_Story_o_req_ttlilt` already gathers and sorts soonest-first,
   line 288 — the soonest is in hand). On expiry it `feebly_ponder`s the owning `w`
    (→ think → reqdo_sweep → the req's do_fn re-runs) and marks expired ttlilts
     `timed_out`, as it already does. The do_fn re-checks and either `finish()`es or
      arms a fresh window. Every `setTimeout(…recheck_pending…feebly_ponder)` and its
       flag is deleted — one impulse, one particle.

This is what "req-requiring" means: the **wake becomes a property of the req** (carried
 by its ttlilt), not a free closure capturing it. The req — *a piece of work amongst
  pieces of work* — owns its own demand for time, fully.

### 8.3 Why this draws a control panel together (and fixes a class of leak)

Two concrete properties fall out of making a timing impulse a particle instead of a
 closure:

- **Inspectable.** Every pending impulse is a `%req/%ttlilt,until_ts` in the tree, so
   *the snap is the control panel* of every timing impulse in the machine — which is
    exactly what §8.1 reads. A `setTimeout` closure is invisible: you cannot snap it,
     diff it, surf it (§3.2), or reason about it.
- **Structurally torn down.** Drop the req subtree → its ttlilt (and its share of the
   coalesced timer) die with it. This is precisely the bug that bit `auto_reset_story`:
    a story drive leaked because its wake was a free `setTimeout` gated on a bare
     `.c.driving` flag, not a req-owned ttlilt — so "stop the drive" was a hand-walk
      that silently no-op'd (it queried `w` one level too high, found nothing, and
       never set `driving=false`). Make the drive's wake a ttlilt and "stop" becomes
        "drop the req," which cannot silently fail.

### 8.4 Three timer families — fold the second into the first

1. **ttlilt** — work demanding time / snap-advisory (`Hovercraft`). Already
    req-attached. ← *gains the wake.*
2. **recheck `setTimeout`s** — the scattered wake + `recheck_pending` dance. ←
    *deleted; absorbed into (1).*
3. **story_drive's poll/do chain** (`Story.svelte`) — the runner's *clock* and the
    *consumer* of ttlilts (`poll_step → o_Story_req_ttlilt`). ← *stays*: a timer that
     reads the ttlilts to decide *when to snap* can't itself be a ttlilt without
      circularity. §15 recasts the *steps it drives* as reqs — whose intra-step waits
       are then family (1).

Don't over-unify (3) into (1): the snap clock is the one timer that legitimately sits
 outside the req tree, because it is the thing *watching* the tree.

### 8.5 Tensions to keep coherent

- **Polled-not-mutated** (heading 5's race-freedom): the ttlilt particle stays polled,
   never mutated in flight. The engine wake re-enters through `feebly_ponder` (think →
    mutex) — the same path the scattered setTimeouts already take, so it is no *more*
     racy, just centralized. The only new mutable state is the engine's coalesced timer
      handle, a `Run.c` ref (off-snap).
- **Don't re-arm in flight** (line 170): "take a picture of slow work, don't extend"
   stays. Expiry marks `timed_out` and the snap captures the held-up picture; a re-arm
    is a *new* slice the do_fn chooses, never a silent extension of the same ttlilt.
- **Coalesce** to one `Run.c` timer at the soonest `until_ts`, recomputed each publish
   — falls out of the existing sort, not N timers.
- **Lifetime against the owning req** (cf §15.4): a ttlilt expires against *its* req and
   vanishes on that req's `finish()`/drop, never leaking into the next step. The
    publisher's drop-on-finished-req (lines 242-244) is half of this; the coalesced
     timer must re-derive from live ttlilts each pass, so a dropped req's wake stops
      being scheduled.

This is the §15 drive recast seen from the timer side, and a direct instance of §17's
 "one control engine": the wake is a second timer built beside ttlilt; collapse it in.

## 9. Islands — the macro map

A big snap is a few large islands plus scatter. Compile subtrees are *large but
 simple* — high node count, low change/fuzz, mostly `Map`/`def` lines. Draw the
  snap zoomed out: each major subtree an **island**, sized by node count, tinted by
   change/fuzz/surprise density. This is itself a graph — **reuse Cyto** (§7) to
    render islands as nodes and containment as edges.

- an all-`same` island stays one collapsed continent you never open;
- a `surprise` lights one island red on an otherwise calm map;
- "Compile, large but simple" becomes one fat pale island — opened only when it
   reddens.

Island membership is a roll-up of the same per-node continuity that drives fronds
 (§6) — islands are just fronds one zoom further out. The macro map and the line
  diff are the same fold predicate at two scales.

## 10. Pip thumbnails — the strip as a contact sheet

Replace the `·`/`○` pip glyph with a tiny **thumbnail of that step's fern-posed
 diff**: unchanged fronds curl to nothing, real changes bloom as marks, fuzz as a
  faint tint, surprise as one bright pixel. The step strip becomes a contact sheet
   — you read the whole run's shape at a glance and click toward the step whose
    thumbnail blooms. The `ok`/`hollow`/`busy` states still ride as border/pulse.
     A surfed object (§3.2) can light its row's pixel across *every* thumbnail, so
      the object's life shows as a streak down the strip.

## 11. More we could dream

Cheap to state, grounded in what now exists:

- **Playback.** Hold → to play the run as a movie: fronds bloom as changes land,
   ttlilts flash, Cyto waves in step. A test becomes a watchable thing.
- **Provenance channel.** A `Snap:wrote` channel could carry *who wrote* a line —
   the ttlilt already knows `req` + `of_w`; thread that to the lines that req
    settled. A changed row then links to its author; surprise rows get blamed
     automatically — and `Snap:H` stays clean.
- **Surprise bisect.** When `surprise` first appears at step K, auto-open K and
   surf the offending object's `bD` chain back to its last calm step — the diff
    narrows itself to the moment it went wrong.
- **Island heatmap over time.** Cross §9 with the TimeSpool (§4.3): which islands
   churn most across the last 10 runs. Rotting subsystems glow.
- **Cross-test islands.** The Compile island in test A vs test B — same structure,
   compare. A fleet-wide island view.
- **Snap minimap gutter.** Like DocMinimap for Wafts: a continuous gutter beside
   the diff marking where blooms and ghosts sit; click to jump.

## 12. Automating many tests

Once a test's non-determinism is a trended number (§4.3) and its real-change
 signal is `surprise > 0`, a fleet of tests becomes mechanically triageable.

- **Green/amber/red without eyeballing.** `surprise==0` ⇒ green. `surprise==0 &&
   fuzz rising` ⇒ amber (drifting). `surprise>0` ⇒ red. No human reads a diff
    unless red or amber.
- **Auto-acknowledge proposals.** When a run is all-`fuzz`+`same`, Story can
   *propose* the fuzz rules that would zero the surprise (it already knows which
    rows are `Dif:change` and what kind they look like — `age`/`counter`/`timing`
     are pattern-detectable). The human confirms; the rule lands in the protocol.
- **Batch reseed.** Resnapture across many tests at once (the `first_snap`/
   Resnapture path already exists per-test); gated so only green-after-reseed
    tests auto-save their new `got_snap`.
- **A TimeSpool dashboard.** Per-test sparklines of `surprise`/`fuzz_rows`/
   `vers_churn` over the last 10 runs — one screen says which tests are rotting.

This is the "somewhat explore" part: the spool + the channels are the substrate;
 the fleet view is a Storui/Diffmaticui surface over many `The/**` trees at once,
  and a test can declare *which channels* it cares about (most want `Snap:H`; a
   flaky one turns on `Snap:trace`; a bug hunt turns on a probe). ⛑️ scope of
    "many" (one repo's tests vs. cross-run history) deferred.

## 13. A test is a Waft — channels are Interests, the cursor traces

Everything above is parts. Here is the whole they assemble into, and it is not new
 machinery — it is the Waft machine (`Waft_spec.md`) pointed at time instead of at a
  source doc. The Story run already half-admits this: its snap rides at a
   `waft_path` (`Story/LakeFlush/Waftily` in the example). Make it true.

### 13.1 The mapping

| Story / Diffmatication        | Waft                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| a test                        | a **Waft** (`%Interest,Testing` already exists) |
| an output channel (§2)        | an **Interest** — *"the Interest is the channel"* |
| a channel's snap text         | a **Doc** in the Waft (`Doc:Snap:H`, `Doc:Snap:trace`) |
| a step (`%Step`)              | a **time-slice `What`** under that Doc — "successive moments" |
| step nav ←/→                  | the **`rwnd | pause | +time`** transport        |
| the pip strip                 | the **sibling-`What` list** / minimap dots      |
| recording a step              | **+time** (cell-division): a new sibling `What` |
| an **assertion** — what to check (§14) | a **Point** — `method|label|class`, a cursored claim |
| a surfed/pinned object (§3.2) | an **engaged Point** (minimap engagement, soft cap 3) |
| a surprise row                | a `focus` Point (enlarge, glow, context bar)    |
| a fuzz / noisy-but-ok row     | a `caution` / `dim` Point                       |
| a gone ref (§5)               | a `ghost` Point — auto-shrinks, 10 s decay      |
| the fern fold (§6)            | the **squish `·····`** convention + `Lang_apply_openness` |
| ttlilt unfold-to-reveal (§8)  | `Lang_apply_openness` opening around an engaged Point |
| the e/r/f channel switch      | the **NaviCado switcher strip** (foreground an Interest) |

None of the right column is hypothetical — it is specced in `Waft_spec.md`. The
 test runner has been re-deriving, separately and worse, machinery that already
  exists for navigating a document. Stop.

### 13.2 Channels are Interests

`%Interest,<kind>` is a family — `Trail`, `Sidetrack`, `Ting`, `GhostList`,
 `Testing` — each a standing lock onto a subject Waft with a `%cursor`, a lens, a
  presence, and a `pending|locked` state. A test's channels are exactly this:

- `Snap:H` is the foreground lens — the clean tree you read (`presence:active`, the
   NaviCado stage).
- `Snap:trace` and the probe channels (§2.5) are `presence:always` ambient slots,
   like the `Ting` heat — rendering in their own slot, never stealing the stage,
    until you foreground one.
- **`pending|locked` is the capture switch.** A declared-but-unattended channel is
   `pending` — known, lens chosen, *no traffic yet*; it `locks` (starts capturing)
    only on foreground. So a test declaring ten high-frequency probes arms **zero**
     capture until you foreground one — the same LE-on-foreground discipline that
      keeps `Trail` from arming every giver Waft's checkout. High-frequency probes
       cost nothing until watched.

The e/r/f keys (§3.1) are then not a bespoke mode toggle — they foreground a
 different channel Interest, exactly as the switcher strip does.

### 13.3 The cursor traces the expected snap

This is the reuse the whole frame turns on. Every Interest carries a `%cursor`
 (`what`/`doc`/`depth`/`off_what`), and moving it is *"the same operation: walk the
  Waft's `C**`, select a chunk"* — today **LiesCurse**, which `Waft_spec` already
   flags as general, its *"name and home want reconsidering once a second kind
    drives a cursor through it."* `Testing` is that second kind.

A `Testing` Interest's cursor traces the channel's **expected** snap:

- its position along the time-slice `What`s **is** the current step. `rwnd`/`+time`
   step it; that is Diffmatication's ←/→.
- at a step, the cursor selects the moment's chunk of the expected snap; the diff
   (Diffmatication's lens) is that selection against the live `got`. exp-mode is
    cursor-vs-live; prev-mode is slice N−1 vs slice N — *which `What`s the cursor
     spans*, nothing more.
- **surfing one object (§3.2)** is anchoring the cursor's `what`/`doc` to one object
   and stepping the time-slice `What`s: the cursor re-selects that object at each
    moment, `depth` walking into its subtree. The continuity channel (§2.3) is what
     lets the cursor *find* the same object in the next slice.

So "trace through expected snaps of various channels" is precisely: one cursor per
 channel-Interest, each walking its Doc's time-slice `What`s, each comparing its
  selection to the live run. The test passes when every channel's cursor traces its
   expected snap without surprise.

### 13.4 +time *is* continuity

The carry-over heuristic (`Waft_spec`) and the continuity map (§2.3) are the same
 operation seen twice. When **+time** mints a new sibling `What`:

- engaged Points **carry forward** into the new slice — these are the objects whose
   continuity holds (`cont`);
- recently-added Points **move** rather than copy — `new` refs;
- everything else **ghosts** in the prior slice — `gone` refs, the §5 ghost rows,
   decaying on the same 10 s timer.

Recording a test step and advancing a Waft's time are one act. The snapper's `bD`
 resolution (§2.3) decides carry-vs-ghost; the Waft's +time renders it. A test that
  grows more non-deterministic (§4.3) is, in this light, a Waft whose +time ghosts
   more each pass — the fern garden visibly fraying.

### 13.5 What it buys, and the forcing function

The win is *deletion*. Diffmatication stops being a bespoke tool and becomes the
 `Testing` Interest's lens; the surf is a cursor walk; the folds are squish; the
  transport, the switcher, the decoration classes, the engagement model all already
   exist for Lang. Story stops being a parallel universe and becomes *Wafts over
    time*. And it resolves the open `Waft_spec` thread — LiesCurse's home — by
     supplying the second cursor-driver that forces the question.

> ⛑️ Tension to resolve: `Waft_spec` scoped time-slice `What`s as a Lang
>  doc-annotation feature (moments of attention on a source doc). Here they host
>   recorded channel snaps. The "moment" semantics match; confirm a time-slice
>    `What` can host a `Doc` whose body *is* a channel snap, and that the cursor
>     walks snap particles the way it walks source lines. If they diverge, the
>      shared engine is the cursor/`Selection.process()`, not the `What` schema.

## 14. Points are Assertions — author what matters, on clean timelines

The whole-snap dige is all-or-nothing: it asserts *everything* and so expresses
 *nothing* — you cannot read it to learn what a test is *for*, and it flips on every
  acknowledged non-determinism the fuzz pass hasn't yet caught. The complement is a
   **Point**. In Waft a Point is a cursored leaf (`method | label | class`); in a
    test it is an **Assertion** — a named claim about the subject that must hold,
     anchored by the cursor (§13.3) to exactly the thing it checks.

Two layers, both wanted:
- **dige** — the safety net: "nothing changed that I didn't expect." Catches
   regressions no one thought to name; fragile to fuzz (that is what §4 wrangles).
- **Points** — the intent: "*these* facts are correct." Few, named, load-bearing,
   and noise-immune by construction — a Point on a non-fuzz value stays green when
    the dige flips on a timestamp. A mature test reads as a handful of Points, not a
     wall of diff.

### 14.1 What a Point can assert

A Point names a channel (§2) and an expectation; the cursor anchors it:

- **value** — this object/field equals X (a dige, a number, a string).
- **continuity** — this object appears at step N | survives to the end | never
   appears (`new`/`gone`/`cont`, §2.3).
- **stability** — `.vers` churns no more than K; a subtree stays `same`-or-`fuzz`
   (no `surprise`) across the run.
- **order | trace** — on `Snap:trace` (§2.4): this elvis fires before that; this
   sequence of attends/thinks/beliefs occurs.
- **shape** — a subtree matches a pattern or count (the squish already counts
   children — "exactly 36").

`class` decorates it: `focus` = critical, `dim` = secondary, `caution` = known-soft.

### 14.2 Making them

Authoring is a click on the surf, not hand-edited snap. While surfing an object
 (§3.2) or hovering a row, **assert this** mints a `Point` on the test Waft anchored
  to that object's D-identity, snapshotting the current value as expected — granular
   Resnapture, per-object instead of whole-snap. Assert on any channel: continuity
    on `Snap:cont`, ordering on `Snap:trace`. Points persist in the test Waft (they
     ride the snap as `Waft/**/Point` particles — declaration, like a Funkcion
      embed, not behaviour).

The surprise detector (§4, §12) **proposes** them: a `Dif:change` no fuzz class
 covers is offered two resolutions — *acknowledge as fuzz* (a rule) or *assert as a
  Point* (a claim). Every surprise thus exits as either named noise or a named
   check; nothing stays merely surprising.

### 14.3 Uncluttered timelines

The primary test view is the **Points, not the diff**. Each Point draws its own
 clean timeline across steps — a strip of pips/thumbnails (§10), green where it
  holds, red where it breaks — free of snap noise. *That* is "the main things to
   check, ascertained and perceived": you read the test's claims and their status at
    a glance, one uncluttered line each, without parsing a snap.

The full diff stays underneath: a Point's timeline expands to the surf of its
 anchored object (§3.2); a broken Point auto-engages and unfolds the fern garden to
  it (the ttlilt-reveal move, §8). Engagement (soft cap 3) chooses which timelines
   are on stage; the rest fold away. A test's health is then a few horizontal strips
    — the assertions — over a folded garden of everything else.

---

## 15. Story's drive as a req** — how and when a step happens

The runner's drive is hand-rolled: `story_drive` is a fixed phase chain
 (`do_step → poll_step → snap_step → snap_step_after_wave → snap_step_finish →
  advance → schedule`, a 200 ms loop). It works, but it is its own little engine
   beside the real one — the req machine (`Hovercraft`, reqy/maz/ttlilt) that
    already exists to model *how and when things happen*. The drive should **be** a
     req**, not a parallel loop. Then the operations actually wanted fall out as
      ordinary req arms.

Two layers of "when," not to be conflated:
- **intra-step settle** — *has this step finished happening?* Already modelled:
   `poll_step` waits for `finished_run` to go fresh-and-stable, and reqs arm a
    **ttlilt** to say "not yet, give me time" before Story snaps (§8). This half
     already cooperates with the req machine; keep it.
- **inter-step fixed point** — *did the last step change anything?* **Not** modelled.
   This is the missing **until-no-more-on_step**: keep arming steps while a step
    still produces change, stop when one yields nothing new.

### 15.1 The step as a req lifecycle

Recast one step as a req** that arms, settles, captures, and rests:

```
req:Step (one-shot, per step)
  maz 0  arm     — fire Think; the world starts reacting
  maz 1  settle  — needs_work while !finished_run or any ttlilt unexpired (§8)
  maz 2  snap    — capture all channels (§2); +time a new What slice (§13.4)
  maz 3  judge   — diff / assert (§14); record surprise / fuzz (§4)
  maz 4  rest    — finish(); the req comes to rest, done with this step
```

`finish()` closing the req **is** the step completing — no `schedule()` timer, no
 `driving` flag. The 200 ms loop becomes "arm the next `req:Step` once the last one
  rested," which is just a req depending on a req.

### 15.2 The operations fall out

- **add-more / the step button** — arm exactly one `req:Step` and let it rest. A
   one-shot, the simplest thing in the machine; the button *is* "arm a step." That
    this is hard today is the symptom: the drive isn't a req, so a single manual step
     has to thread the hand-rolled phase chain instead of just arming one.
- **until-no-more-on_step** — an **eternal** `req:Drive` that each tick arms a
   `req:Step` if the last step's judge reported change, and rests when a step reports
    *nothing new*. "Nothing new" is exactly readable from the channels: no
     `Dif:change` outside fuzz, no `new`/`gone` in `Snap:cont` (§2.3).
      Run-to-quiescence is loop-until-`Dif:same` — the fixed-point detector is the
       diff already computed.
- **run-to-N | run-to-assert** — variants: step until step N, until a named Point
   (§14) flips, or until `surprise > 0` (stop on the first real change — a
    breakpoint).

### 15.3 What replaces "creating" mode

The global `mode:'new'` (record) vs check split is the awkward part: it makes
 *driving* depend on *why* you drive. In the req** it dissolves. Driving is always
  the same — arm, settle, snap, judge, rest. "Recording" is only what **judge
   (maz 3)** does when there is no expected to compare against: accept the `got` as
    the Point's expected (§14.2) rather than diff it. Recording becomes a per-step,
     per-channel, per-Point decision (accept this), not a mode the whole run sits in.
      An unasserted channel simply records; an asserted one checks; both step
       identically.

### 15.4 Why a clearer req** is the fix

The drive's troubles — the manual step that won't behave, the not-useful create
 mode — are all one thing: the runner keeps its own notion of *when*, parallel to
  the real one. Once `req:Step`/`req:Drive` are ordinary reqs, *when* a step happens
   is the req machine's existing answer (maz descent, `needs_work`, ttlilt),
    *whether* another happens is one eternal req reading the diff, and *what kind* of
     step (record vs check) is just the judge phase. It is the §13 lesson one layer
      down — a hand-rolled engine beside the req machine; same fix, stop
       parallelising. ⛑️ lifetimes need care: `req:Step` is one-shot (rest = step
        done), `req:Drive` is eternal (survives ticks), and intra-step ttlilts must
         expire against *their* `req:Step`, never leak into the next — the wake-owning
          ttlilt (§8.2) makes that lifetime structural: drop `req:Step` and its
           ttlilt's share of the coalesced timer dies with it.

### 15.5 The lost wakeup the parallel drive can drop (and the watchdog net)

The sharpest cost of the parallel drive is a **lost wakeup**: a step that never
 ends because the queue that feeds it stalled and nobody noticed. The drive trusts
  that a non-empty `Run.todo` will drain itself, but the drain path is lossy:

- `answer_calls` fires `_really_answer_calls()` **async and unawaited**, then a 50 ms
   throttle timer clears `answer_calls_waiting` *independently of whether that work
    finished* — so liveness rides on an `answer_calls_pending` flag and the
     `todo_version` `$effect` lining back up, not on the work itself.
- the pushes that *should* re-arm it are themselves deferred: `i_elvisto` parks its
   `_push_todo` inside a `clear()` (a mutex re-acquire), and `feebly_ponder → main`
    routes through a `throttle()` that can **coalesce away** the very `think` meant to
     kick the next cycle.

Drop any one of those and the House goes **idle out of Atime** — `finished_run` set,
 no cycle running — with `Run.todo` **still non-empty**. `poll_step`, which only ever
  *waited* on quiescence, then waits **forever**: its `setTimeout` "comes back
   infinitely," which reads like a spin but is the opposite — a frozen machine. The
    tell is the trace: a **static** trace (no new events) while the step clock climbs
     is a lost wakeup; a **growing** trace that never settles is the other failure,
      an infinite re-enqueue (churn). Same dead step, opposite cause — don't conflate
       them; the trace is what tells them apart.

The net, until the drive is a real req** (§15.1): a **watchdog** in `poll_step`. When
 it sees exactly the deadlock signature — `not_in_Atime && Run.todo.length` — it stops
  trusting and drives the drain itself (`Run.answer_calls()`), `not_in_Atime` guarding
   against re-entering a live cycle and `answer_calls`' own throttle guarding against
    repeats. A dropped wakeup self-heals on the next tick instead of wedging. A
     throttled **`rekick` trace** marks each intervention, so the two failure modes are
      legible at runtime (rekick-then-lands = lost wakeup; rekick-forever = churn) and
       the event *before* the rekick names the last thing that happened before the drop.

This is the §15 lesson at its bluntest: the parallel drive keeps its own notion of
 *liveness* beside the engine's, and pays for it with a class of silent forever-wait.
  The watchdog makes `poll_step` the liveness authority instead of a trusting observer
   — reliable, but still a net over fragility. Recast the drive as `req:Step`/`req:Drive`
    and the wake becomes ttlilt-owned (§8.2): there is no separate `todo_version`/throttle
     handshake to drop, so the whole class dissolves rather than being caught.

## 16. Running it UIless — the agent as test driver

Today a test runs only inside the live browser machine: `Otro` constructs `H:Mundo`,
 calls `may_begin`, wires the child Houses, and `go_busily → think`, all in `$effect`s
  with the UI mounted alongside, served by the Vite dev server in a secure context
   (WebRTC, `/music`). To let **you** — the agent, or CI — *write a test, run it, read
    the result, iterate* — the machine needs a programmatic entry that boots and
     drives without the UI, and a runtime it can execute outside the dev server. Three
      pieces, and the order matters.

1. **A programmatic Otro.** Otro is just the app shell. A UIless form keeps the
    House construction and the `think` pump and drops the Svelte mounting and the
     reactive `houses` list — boot, run, emit, exit. The machine is already
      UI-agnostic (ghosts are logic modules; the UI only *watches* via `watch_c`/
       `$effect`), so what has to come loose is the `$effect`-driven boot and the
        assumption of a live document and secure context a pure Story run never needs.
         This is *"a new or other, more programmatic form of Otro."*

2. **A runtime bundle from Compile.** The ghost methods already run through the
    compile pipeline — Lies/Lang compile, Pantheate dynamic-imports the compiled
     module, `BlastPit` lands the call in-step, and `e_Rundown_arm` already fires
      *"from Prep/test script."* Turn that into a **standard runtime bundling**:
       Compile emits a self-contained artifact — compiled ghost methods + the House
        runtime — that node executes directly, no Vite, no browser. The pipeline that
         exists for live editable docks doubles as the build step for a runnable test
          artifact, and it pins versions for free: `Rundown` already hashes Codebits
           into a `path:dige` moment id, so the bundle *is* that moment, frozen.

3. **The drive, scripted.** This is why §15 is the keystone. With the drive a req**
    (`req:Step`/`req:Drive`), a UIless run is a script: hand in the test Waft, run
     `until-no-more-on_step`, read the channels (§2) as text, check the Points (§14).
      No UI, no timers — the req machine settles each step and the script reads
       `Snap:H` / `Snap:cont` / `Snap:trace` and the assertion verdicts straight off
        the C tree. The true-text principle (§2) pays off precisely here: the agent
         reads the *same clean channels a human reads*.

What it enables: the agent writes a Story test as a script, runs the bundle UIless,
 reads pass/fail plus the failing Point's surf (§14.3) and the diff (§3) as text, and
  iterates — the authoring loop with no human at the browser. CI runs the same bundle.
   ⛑️ the UIless boot needs context shims (no WebRTC, no `/music`, no secure
    context); scope the bundle to the ghosts a Story run actually touches.

### 16.1 Refinements, once the runner exists

The runner is built (`scripts/Story_cli.*`, via vitest's transform instead of the
 Compile bundle — see `Story_cli_docs.md`); it dumps a pile of files per Book. It now
  reaches the **Creduler-ACQUIRED** Books too (PereStaple et al.), not only on-disk-fixture
   Books: `scripts/CredRunner.spec.ts` mounts a shell that renders the dynamic `watched:UIs`
    includes (`scripts/Story_cli_runner.svelte` — the "minimal Otro over the Run's UIs" this
     section called for) and cranks `Creduler_ensure` before the Story, so the spine +
      `Run_A_<Book>` are live headless. (Build log: the "Runner access" tiers in
       `Peeroleum_handover.md`.) Two refinements remain, both about *what* and *when* the pile emits:

- **Emission frequencies — a "pause-as-soon-as-wobble" mode.** Today the dump is
   everything-at-once: drive the whole Book, then serialise every step. Add a mode that
    stops and dumps at the **first non-fuzz surprise** (§4.2's classifier decides
     fuzz vs genuine), so a long Book under investigation halts on the interesting frame
      instead of burying it. This is the UIless analogue of a debugger breakpoint, with
       the fuzz classifier as the condition.

- **Diff channels in the pile.** The pile is currently `Snap:H` + the trace channel. Once
   the encoder merge (§1–2) lands its plural channels, the pile should grow
    `Snap:cont`/`Snap:refs` files beside `Snap:H`, so "grep a *kind* of diff" works offline
     — continuity goners (§2.3, §5) and shared-ref structure each get their own greppable
      file, not just the merged main snap.

- **A live-runner explorer (BUILT — over the relay, not the pile).** `scripts/story_repl.mjs` is a
   readline shell over the `runner_ask` RPC (the relay's corr-routed CLI↔browser channel — `Lies_runner_ask_recv`
    in `LiesFunk.svelte`, `on('runner_ask')` in `LiesLies.svelte`): drive a runner ALREADY running in a
     browser (`?B=<Book>`) — `run`/`watch`/`state`/`steps`/`snap`/`diff` — and read its live verdict plus a
      colourised `diff <n>` (live `got_snap` vs the baked expected) **as text**, the §16 loop pointed at a
       real-time / real-audio browser run instead of the headless pile. First use caught a MusuLive stale-bake
        counter drift (`self,round`) as fuzz, not surprise (§4.2) — the diff localised it instantly. Brief:
         `spec/Music_todo.md` §6.2. The expected side still rides the shared-disk fixture; driving the
          `fetch_snap` read in the handler so it travels over the socket too is the natural completion of
           "diff channels" above.

## 17. The realisations, and the order they imply

Step back from Story. The same few shapes recur across the whole machine — Lang,
 Lies, Cyto, Story — and the next level is less "build features" than **collapse the
  hand-rolled copies onto the primitives that already exist.**

**Four primitives, found over and over:**

1. **One walk-and-select.** `Selection.process()` / the cursor / `LiesCurse` /
    `beliefs()` / the encode walk / Cyto's `make_wave` / the planned `regroup()` Map
     pass are all *"walk a `C**`, select chunks."* This spec keeps rediscovering it
      (§1, §2, §13.3). There should be one walker; the rest are calls with a
       different `each_fn` / lens.
2. **One delta.** `bD`-resolution is the single diff under Cyto (§7), continuity
    (§2.3), Diffmatication (§3), and quiescence (§15 — `until-no-more` is
     loop-until-`Dif:same`). Compute it once; render it as a wave, rows, marks, or a
      fixed-point test.
3. **One control engine.** The req** (`Hovercraft` — maz, ttlilt, lifetimes) is *how
    and when things happen.* Story's drive (§15), Lies' compile/run (Cortex/Rundown),
     and channel capture (Interest `pending|locked`, §13.2) all want to be reqs.
4. **One container.** Waft / What / Doc / Point + Interest (§13) holds docs, tests,
    channels, steps (time-slice Whats), and assertions (Points). One grammar, many
     readings.

**The recurring anti-pattern** is the thread tying every section together: each
 trouble is *a second engine built beside one that already exists* — two encoders
  (§1), three identity-derivations (§2.3), Story's drive beside the reqs (§15), the
   whole test machine beside the Waft machine (§13). So the next level is mostly
    **deletion**. The measure of a good change here is how much bespoke machinery it
     *removes*.

**The order this implies** — the dependency *logic*, distinct from the shippable
 Staging list:

- **Control first.** The drive as a req** (§15) is the keystone: it makes the machine
   *scriptable* → *UIless-runnable* (§16) → *agent-testable*. That loop is what lets
    every later change be verified cheaply, so nothing precedes it.
- **Substrate next.** One walker, one encoder, channels as true text (§1, §2), with
   the delta (§2.3, §7) riding on top.
- **Container then.** The Waft/Interest/cursor unification (§13) and Points/Assertions
   (§14) — once a scriptable run emits text channels, expressing it as Wafts-over-time
    with asserted Points is the *payoff*, not the prerequisite.
- **Views last.** Diffmatication, fern gardens, islands, thumbnails, fleet (§3, §6,
   §9–§12) are renderings of the above; none blocks correctness.

The Staging list below is ordered for *shippability* (encoder merge first, as a
 provable no-op). The logic above runs **control → substrate → container → views**,
  with **UIless agent-running (§16) as the early payoff that pays for everything
   after it.**

---

## 18. Staging

1. **Merge the encoder.** Move `snap_H`'s loopy pass into `encode_wh_lines`; recast
    `story_process_node` rules as `STORY_PROTOCOL`; route Story through `enWaft`
     with `matching: STORY_PROTOCOL`. Snaps should be byte-identical before/after
      (the regression gate is the existing `*.snap` fixtures in `wormhole/Story/`).
2. **Channels split.** Make `enWaft` return named channels; lift `loopy`/`hid` out
    of `Snap:H` into `Snap:refs`. `Snap:H` gets *cleaner* — fixtures change once,
     deliberately, and the change is "noise removed." Teach `deL` to peel a glyph
      off a token (§2.2) so the lightweight mark path exists.
3. **Continuity channel.** Have `enWaft` keep its `Selection` and emit `Snap:cont`
    (`cont`/`new`/`gone`/`vers`) from the `bD` resolution.
4. **Diffmatication on channels.** Replace `dm_identity` string-parse with the
    snapper's D-identity from `Snap:cont`; add `r`/`e`/`f` keys; pin-and-surf
     (§3.2); per-channel mode switch.
5. **Fuzz classes.** Add `%fuzz,kind` to the protocol; render `Dif:fuzz`; re-pip.
6. **TimeSpool trend.** Extend samples per channel (§4.3); slope; surface
    `surprise`.
7. **Trace channel.** Capture `Run.trace` as `Snap:trace`; fuzz-wrangle timing/
    ordering; dige it. Then focused probe channels (§2.5).
8. **Cyto symmetry.** Factor the `bD`-diff into one primitive (§7); cross-drive
    row↔node. Cheap after stage 4, since both read `Snap:cont`/`Snap:refs`.
9. **ttlilt surfacing + wake.** List held-by ttlilts per step from `Run_trace`; link
    to req rows (§8.1). Companion: fold the wake into ttlilt (§8.2) — one coalesced
     engine timer, delete the scattered `recheck`/`setTimeout` sites — so every timing
      impulse is a particle, droppable with its req. Pairs with the §15 drive recast.
10. **Fern garden.** Continuity-driven fold predicate + the curl widget; then
     ttlilt unfold-to-reveal lands for free.
11. **Islands + thumbnails.** Macro map (§9) and pip contact sheet (§10), both
     rollups of the §10 fold predicate.
12. **Points/Assertions.** Author Points from the surf (§14.2); per-Point timelines
     (§14.3); surprise→Point proposal. The shift from reading diffs to reading
      assertions — do early enough that later tests are *written* as Points.
13. **Fleet.** Multi-test triage surface (§12).

The drive recast (§15) is a **parallel track**, orthogonal to the encoder/channel
 work, and the keystone of the dependency order (§17) — worth doing **first**, not
  just early. Once the drive is a req** you can arm one step at a time and
   run-to-quiescence on demand (the step button, `until-no-more-on_step`); the
    UIless boot + Compile bundle (§16) follow directly, and *that* loop — agent
     writes a test, runs it, reads text, iterates — is what makes every stage below
      cheap to verify. This track touches `story_drive` / `Otro` / the compile
       pipeline, not the snap fixtures, so it ships independently of the merge.

Each stage is shippable and gated by the snap fixtures. Stage 1 is pure
 de-duplication and should change *nothing* observable — do it first and prove it.
  Stage 2 only *removes* noise from `Snap:H`; every later channel is additive.

The Waft unification (§13) is not a stage so much as the *direction* every stage
 points: build each part (channel, cursor-surf, fold, transport, switcher) so it
  drops cleanly into the `Testing` Interest later, rather than as Diffmatication-only
   code that has to be re-merged. Concretely — surf reuses the cursor (§13.3), not a
    new walker; the fold is squish (§6/§13.1), not a bespoke collapser; the e/r/f
     switch foregrounds a channel (§13.2), not an ad-hoc enum. Whether to formally
      reparent Story under `%Interest,Testing` can come last; building *toward* it
       costs nothing extra and saves the re-merge.

## Open / deferred

- ⛑️ Loopy *decode* still throws in `decode_wh_lines`. With refs lifted to
   `Snap:refs` (§2.1), `Snap:H` decodes *without* loopy at all — the re-link is a
    second pass that reads `Snap:refs` and stitches the shared `C` back. That may
     be easier than in-band loopy-decode, and it's what a replaying Cyto (§7) needs.
- ⛑️ Channel sync. Channels are separate snaps but describe one step; `Snap:cont`
   and `Snap:refs` reference `Snap:H` lines (by D-identity, not line number, so
    edits don't break them). Define the cross-channel reference key once.
- ⛑️ Glyph collision. A unicode mark on a peelable (§2.2) must use glyphs that can't
   occur in a sayable value, or `deL` can't tell mark from content. Reserve a small
    private-use band; `peel`/`depeel` own the reserve list.
- ⛑️ Identity across a *reload* (new session, C rebuilt from snap). In-session the
   snapper resolves D-identity off live refs; cold-start from a saved snap must
    re-establish the same resolution from the line content alone (full identity +
     path) — deterministic from the snap, so the chain re-links, but verify it.
- ⛑️ Fuzz `kind:ordering` is the hard one — set/map order. May need the encoder to
   sort deterministically rather than label, i.e. *remove* the non-determinism
    rather than acknowledge it. Acknowledge only what can't be sorted away.
- Open: does the standing continuity (the kept `Selection`) belong in `H.ave`
   beside `This` and the Matstyle swatches (session-scoped, graph-clean) or on
    `Run.c` (per-run)? Lean `H.ave` so Cyto/Matstyle can read it too — a node could
     pulse on a `.vers` bump using the same wave machinery (§7).
