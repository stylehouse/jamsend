// Another Things/Thing thing!

we need to hierarchise FileLists, and allow them to be opened several times:
 in the Pier's PF context, one can look for something just for that Pier. 
 that will generate another type of Things classifying Selections of folders
   as interesting or of some genre or occasion.

Selections are then sendable to particular Piers.
 So it mostly moves whole folders.

And we want to replicate the meaningful folder structure above the selected stuff..
 music will generally be organised like this:
  0 somegenre/Some Artist/Some Album (1990)/01 Track.opus
 we will allow CRUD on each part of that hierarchy, but don't get lost in that just yet.

Lets make file lists multi-level first!
Any thoughts?
